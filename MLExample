1. Examples of AI

CALCUL ATORS
Devices that perform mathematical calculations, a classic example of narrow AI that excels at a specific task.

VOICE ASSISTANTS LIKE SIRI OR ALEXA
AI-powered virtual assistants that can understand and respond to natural language, enabling hands- free interaction and voice-based control of various tasks.

SELF-DRIVING CARS
Vehicles equipped with AI-powered systems that can navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions without human intervention, showcasing the potential of AI in transportation

RECOGNIZING OBJECTS BY PICTURE NAME
AI models trained on large datasets of images that can accurately identify and classify objects, animals, or scenes depicted in photographs, demonstrating advancements in computer vision.

CHATBOTS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE
AI-powered conversational agents that can engage in natural language interactions to assist customers with queries, complaints, or othersupport requests, automating an

2. ML Model Testing

Approaches of AI

- Rule Based Systems
* An earlier form of AI that uses manually programmed 'if-then' rules derived from expert knowledge to make decisions.

-	MACHINE LEARNING
* A more advanced approach to AI that learns from data, identifying patterns and relationships to make predictions or decisions, without relying on predefined rules.

3. Strengths and Limitations of Rule Based Testing
- Ease of understanding and adaptability -80%
- Transparency -85%
- Ability to learn and Adapt -20%
- Performance in complex environments  -30%

4. What is ML
- Machine Learning is a specific approach to achieve Artificial Intelligence (AI) by giving machines access to data and allowing them to learn for themselves. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine is trained on data, and it learns patterns and relationships from this data to make decisions or predictions.

5. Strengths and Limitations of ML
- Flexibility- 90%
- Scalability-85%
- Interpretability- 60%
- Datasetsize Requirement - 80%

6. ML model lifecycle stages with online/offline modes
- Offline- Data Preparation ->Model Engineering ->Model Evaluation 
- Online -> Model Deployment ->Operations->Monitor and Evaluate-> Plan->Data Preparation
- Business and Data Understanding -> Plan
