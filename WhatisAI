What is AI?
COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD
AI is a broad field of computer science
focused on creating systems that can
perform tasks typically requiring human
intelligence.
INTELLIGENT TASKS
These tasks include problem-solving,
natural language understanding, pattern
recognition, and decision-making.
EXAMPLES
Examples of AI include calculators, voice
assistants, self-driving cars, object
recognition, and chatbots.
AS AI AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, WE CAN
EXPECT TO SEE EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE AI APPLICATIONS IN THE FUTURE

Examples of AI
CALCULATORS
Devices that perform mathematical calculations, a
classic example of narrow AI that excels at a
specific task.
VOICE ASSISTANTS LIKE SIRI OR
ALEXA
AI-powered virtual assistants that can understand
and respond to natural language, enabling handsfree interaction and voice-based control of various
tasks.
SELF-DRIVING CARS
Vehicles equipped with AI-powered systems that
can navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make
driving decisions without human intervention,
showcasing the potential of AI in transportation.
RECOGNIZING OBJECTS BY
PICTURE NAME
AI models trained on large datasets of images that
can accurately identify and classify objects,
animals, or scenes depicted in photographs,
demonstrating advancements in computer vision.
CHATBOTS THAT PROVIDE
CUSTOMER SERVICE
AI-powered conversational agents that can engage
in natural language interactions to assist
customers with queries, complaints, or other
support requests, automating and imp

The Approaches of AI
RULE-BASED SYSTEMS
An earlier form of AI that uses manually
programmed 'if-then' rules derived from expert
knowledge to make decisions.
MACHINE LEARNING
A more advanced approach to AI that learns from
data, identifying patterns and relationships to
make predictions or decisions, without relying on
predefined rules

Examples of Machine Learning
SPAM FILTERS IN EMAIL
Machine learning models are trained on
large datasets of spam and non-spam
emails to learn the patterns and
characteristics of spam messages. These
models can then automatically detect and
filter out spam emails in a user's inbox.
RECOMMENDATION ENGINES
Netflix, YouTube, and other platforms use
machine learning algorithms to analyze
user preferences, browsing history, and
other data to provide personalized
recommendations for movies, videos, and
other content the user is likely to enjoy.
PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE IN
INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS
Machine learning models can be trained
on sensor data from industrial equipment
to predict when maintenance or repairs
will be needed. This helps optimize
maintenance schedules, reduce downtime,
and prevent costly breakdowns.

Examples of Machine Learning
IMAGE
CLASSIFICATION
Machine learning models
can be trained to
recognize and classify
different objects, animals,
or scenes in images with
high accuracy.
SPAM FILTERING
Machine learning
algorithms can analyze
email content and header
data to accurately
identify and filter out
spam messages based on
patterns learned from
previous examples.
FRAUD DETECTION
Financial institutions use
machine learning to
analyze transaction data
and detect anomalies or
suspicious activities that
may indicate fraudulent
behavior.
RECOMMENDATION
SYSTEMS
E-commerce and media
platforms leverage
machine learning to
analyze user preferences
and behaviors to provide
personalized product or
content
recommendations.
NATURAL LANGUAGE

Machine learning models
can be trained to
understand, interpret, and
generate human
language, enabling

ypes of Machine Learning
SUPERVISED LEARNING
The model is trained on
labeled data, meaning the
input comes with the correct
output. Examples include
spam filtering, image
classification, and predictive
analytics.
UNSUPERVISED
LEARNING
The model is trained on
unlabeled data and must find
patterns and relationships in
the data. Examples include
customer segmentation,
anomaly detection, and
recommendation systems.
REINFORCEMENT
LEARNING
The model learns by
interacting with an
environment and receiving
rewards or penalties based on
its actions. Examples include
game-playing algorithms,
robotics, and resource
management.
chatbots, language
translation, and text
summarization.
