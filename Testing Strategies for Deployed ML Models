-Testing Strategies for Deployed ML Models
-After deploying an ML model into production, various tests ensure its stability, performance, and accuracy. These validate the model's real-world performance and monitor its behavior over time.

Integration Testing
Purpose
Ensures smooth integration with the larger production system.

Proess
QA teams verify effective communication between model and system components.

Key Aspets
Correct data flow, API functionality, and input/output data format consistency.

Lateny Testing
1 Purpose
Ensures predictions are made within an acceptable time frame.

2 Proess
Measure prediction time and ensure it meets defined SLAs.

3 Key Aspets
Response time under normal and peak load, scalability testing.

Drift Testing
Data Drift
Changes in distribution of input data.

Concept Drift
Changes in relationship between input and output.

Monitoring
Set up alerts for changes in data distributions or accuracy.

Shadow Testing
1 Purpose
Run new model in shadow mode without affecting real-world applications.

2Proess
Test with live data, log and compare predictions with production model.

3Key Aspets
Validate performance on live data, identify discrepancies, ensure expected behavior.

A/B Testing
Purpose
Compares new model performance against existing model with real users.

Process
Split user traffic between current (A) and new (B) models.

Key Aspets
Compare metrics, evaluate user interactions, ensure statistical significance.

Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time dashboards 
- Data drift monitoring 
- Automated retraining 
- Track accuracy, precision, recall, latency
- Trigger alerts for performance drops
- Update model with new data patterns
