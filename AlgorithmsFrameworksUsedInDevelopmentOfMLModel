- Supervised Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression
Used for predicting a continuous value by learning the relationship between input features and target variable.

Random Forests
An ensemble method that uses many decision trees to improve classification or regression performance by reducing
overfitting and increasing stability.

Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification tasks, such as spam detection or loan approval, by learning the probability of a binary outcome.

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Another ensemble technique that builds decision trees in a sequential manner, correcting the errors of the previous trees
to improve overall performance.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Effective in high-dimensional spaces, used for both regression and classification tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane that
maximizes the margin between classes.

Neural Networks
Highly flexible models capable of handling various types of data and tasks, including image and speech recognition, by
learning complex patterns in data. 

Decision Trees
Used for both classification and regression, forming a tree-like model of decisions based on feature values to make predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure, such as distance
functions.

- Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

K-Means Clustering
Automatically partition a dataset into K distinct groups based on feature similarities

Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
Similar to PCA but finds components that are maximally independent of each other

Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a tree of clusters, particularly useful for hierarchical data like taxonomies

Autoencoders
Neural network-based models used for learning efficient codings of unlabeled data

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
An approach where two models are trained simultaneously; one generates candidates and the other evaluates them

-Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Q-Learning
A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state.

Actor-Critic Methods
Combine the benefits of value iteration and policy gradient methods by using two models: one for the policy and one as the value estimator.

Deep Q Network (DQN)
Combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value functions.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
Used in decision processes for calculating statistics by averaging over sample paths at a decision node.

Policy Gradient Methods
Learn a parameterized policy that can be optimized directly.

A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
Uses deep learning and a variant of actor-critic methods with a parallel architecture to improve training speed and stability.
